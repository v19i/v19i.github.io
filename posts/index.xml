The primary goal of Test-driven development (TDD) is to force a quick feedback loop that forces you to write in small steps.
TDD imposes writing first a test for a code that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been written yet and then writing enough code to make it produce the desired output and nothing more.</description></item><item><title>Use The Platform: URL API</title><link>https://v19i.com/posts/use-the-platform-url-api/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 May 2021 09:23:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://v19i.com/posts/use-the-platform-url-api/</guid><description>Use The Platform: URL API Modern web JavaScript provides an intuitive and feature-rich interface to parse, create and edit URLs info.
This page illustrates only the parts that I use the most; for the full spec, have a look at URL and URLSearchParams.
Create a URL A URL is created by instantiating a new URL instance:
const url = new URL(&amp;#34;https://v19i.com&amp;#34;); Manage search params The created object provides an easy interface to add, edit and remove search params; it behaves similarly to Map.</description></item><item><title>Lines in Four Directions by Sol Lewitt</title><link>https://v19i.com/posts/lines-in-four-directions-by-sol-lewitt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2021 16:58:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://v19i.com/posts/lines-in-four-directions-by-sol-lewitt/</guid><description> Lines In Four Directions by Sol Lewitt</description></item><item><title>On Agile software development</title><link>https://v19i.com/posts/on-agile-software-development/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 10:01:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://v19i.com/posts/on-agile-software-development/</guid><description>On Agile software development An often distorted view In the past year, I’ve run many interviews for project-manager and engineering roles. One common thing I’ve noticed is that the industry’s idea of what Agile means, is incredibly varied, going from something that is waterfall under a different name, to a style that requires specific “Agile roles” in a team.
In this post, I’ll go through what the initial idea of Agile was, and what it should be; hopefully, this will help people realise how far from the original purpose they’ve steered.</description></item></channel></rss>
