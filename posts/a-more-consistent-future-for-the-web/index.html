Gone are the days when browsers didn&rsquo;t receive updates for years or had vastly different feature support. Now, a new way of developing browsers has become the norm, the so-called evergreen browsers. As continuous delivery has grown in adoption in the software industry, browsers have started to release new versions more often, even with a predefined cadence and multiple channels, to test newer features before they reach the stable channel.</p><p>We went from having browsers hardly ever-changing to constantly changing, each with a different focus on what to support first. This improved what can be done natively within a website but increased the burden on the developers to keep up with which features are available in each browser.</p><p>The Baseline will give teams a target to use and develop against and allow them to create a compelling experience knowing that up-to-date browsers will support all the features from a Baseline.</p><h4 id=from-mdnhttpsdevelopermozillaorgen-usdocsglossarybaselinecompatibilitys-baseline-page>From <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Baseline/Compatibility>MDN</a>’s Baseline page:</h4><blockquote><p><strong>Baseline</strong> identifies widely-supported web platform features. Web developers can expect Baseline features to work in contemporary browsers.</p><p>A Baseline feature - such as an API, a set of CSS properties, or a JavaScript syntax - is known to work consistently in the current and previous major versions of several well-known browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari).</p></blockquote><h2 id=how-to-use-them>How to use them</h2><p>Baseline adherence for each feature can be found on all MDN web pages. Here is an example of what a safe-to-use feature looks like:</p><p><img src=./grid_baseline_support.png alt="Example of Baseline result on MDN"></p><p>WebDX created a handy npm package called <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-features>web-features</a> to check feature support via JavaScript.</p><h2 id=where-to-go-to-know-more>Where to go to know more</h2><p>To keep up to date with what the WebDX will do, follow their <a href=https://www.w3.org/community/webdx/>official website</a>.</p><h2 id=how-to-get-involved>How to get involved</h2><p>There are a few ways to get involved:</p><ol><li>Help the <a href=https://openwebdocs.org>open web docs project</a> by improving the MDN Web Docs contribution, sponsoring the project or talking about it at events or social media.</li><li>Help keeping the <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-features>web-features</a> npm package up-to-date via providing feedback or creating a PR at: <a href=https://github.com/web-platform-dx/feature-set/issues>https://github.com/web-platform-dx/feature-set/issues</a></li></ol><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>The Baseline is a significant step towards a more consistent and predictable web development environment. It will help developers, companies and customers streamline which features to rely on while ideating and building for the web. Showing your support and helping spread the use and contribution to the project is the best way to see it succeed.</p><footer><time class=post-publication-date datetime=2023-05-19>19 May 2023</time></footer></div><script src=/js/theme-colour-updater.min.e86ef29fe900bc4a4d398f74161f815491d921b202076526f0cb0b8ce9062101.mjs type=module integrity="sha256-6G7yn+kAvEpNOY90Fh+BVJHZIbICB2Um8MsLjOkGIQE="></script></body></html>
