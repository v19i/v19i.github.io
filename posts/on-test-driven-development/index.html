Be ruthless in refactoring, the test suite is there to spot any error.</p><h2 id=start-with-a-plan>Start with a plan</h2><p>Writing TDD doesn&rsquo;t mean starting without a clear idea of what to build. Start by writing a spec of what the result should look like, it will help write the tests.</p><p>That spec will probably not resemble the one we come up with at the end, and that’s ok; the final result will be much better.</p><h2 id=start-from-the-end>Start from the end</h2><p>Writing a good test should start from the end. Force yourself to write the API or result and walk backwards towards a way to get there.</p><p>Design your code the way you want it to be used, not how you need it to be tested.</p><h2 id=dont-ask-too-much>Don&rsquo;t ask too much</h2><p>Each test should bring the code closer to the final result. Start from the most basic behaviour and work towards the end goal by satisfying all the requirements necessary to achieve it. By avoiding writing the complex tests, the code will gradually grow, giving you time to refactor after each test quickly.</p><h3 id=books>Books</h3><p>I recommend these two books to understand how to reason about TDD</p><ul><li>Test-Driven Development by Example</li><li>Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests</li></ul><footer><time class=post-publication-date datetime=2022-06-08>8 Jun 2022</time></footer></div><script src=/js/theme-colour-updater.min.e86ef29fe900bc4a4d398f74161f815491d921b202076526f0cb0b8ce9062101.mjs type=module integrity="sha256-6G7yn+kAvEpNOY90Fh+BVJHZIbICB2Um8MsLjOkGIQE="></script></body></html>
